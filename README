BioSeq.js
=========

Javascript implementation of a biomolecular sequence object, standard
functions/methods for sequence manipulation, and I/O for the FASTA format.

Designed for server-side Javascript, namely Node.js. I'm not sure what tweaks
are needed to make it useful client-side.

Sequence class:
    - Attributes are data (the character sequence), sequence id, sequence
      description, alphabet, features, and arbitrary annotations (the last three
      don't do anything yet)
